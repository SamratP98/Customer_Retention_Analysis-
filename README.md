# Customer_Retention_Analysis-
Analyzing details about the churn dataset and creating a dashboard in Power Bi.

Hello everyone,

As part of my learning journey, I'm sharing my 10th project which I have done as part of Pwc's virtual case experience program. In this video, I discuss the problems and insights which I get from the raw data.



The project is based on Churn Dataset and includes valuable learnings such as:

1. Presentation of raw data in a format that is clean and presentable

2. Created an interactive dashboard to track & analyze sales data.

3. Used complex parameters to drill down in worksheets and customization using filters and slicers.

4. Introduction to DAX and Data Modelling

5. Used different types of customized visualization.

6. Generating insights through the report on profit/loss of business.
